# HERO.IO – Productive Apps Hub

## Description

HERO.IO is a React-based web application that showcases trending and available applications in a clean, modern UI.  
The project includes features such as app browsing, installation simulation, search, filtering, error handling, and detailed app pages – built following Figma design references.  

Users can:
- Browse all applications in a grid layout.  
- View detailed app information (ratings, downloads, reviews, description).  
- Install apps (saved to localStorage) and see them in *My Installation*.  
- Uninstall apps with a toast notification.  
- Search apps by title with a loading spinner while filtering.  
- Sort installed apps by downloads (High → Low, Low → High).  
- Navigate across pages with a Navbar and Footer.  
- Handle errors with custom *404 Page* and *App Not Found Page*.
